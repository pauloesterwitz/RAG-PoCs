# RAG Lab — Comparing Six RAG Pipelines with DeepEval

A self-contained lab that builds **six RAG pipelines** over a corpus of PDFs,
evaluates them end-to-end with **DeepEval**, and ships a **Vue** web app to
re-embed, chat with any approach (retrieved chunks always quoted), and compare
results on an interactive dashboard.

Supports two LLM providers, switchable via environment variable:

| Provider | Generation & Judging | Embeddings |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Claude** (default) | Anthropic API — `claude-sonnet-4-6` for answers, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for judging | `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` via sentence-transformers (384-d, no server) |
| **Ollama** | Any local model (e.g. `qwen3.6:35b-a3b-q8_0`) | `embeddinggemma:latest` (768-d) |

## Six RAG Approaches

### 1. Plain RAG (`plain`)

The baseline. Retrieval is a **hybrid of dense vector search and BM25**:

1. Embed the query with the configured embedding model.
2. Score all chunks by cosine similarity (dense) and by BM25 (sparse keyword).
3. Fuse the two score lists with a weighted sum (default `bm25_weight=0.35`).
4. Pass the top-k chunks verbatim to the LLM as numbered sources.

No query transformation, no reranking, no iterative retrieval — the cleanest
baseline for comparing what each additional step is worth.

### 2. RAG + Reranker (`rerank`)

Retrieves a **wider candidate pool** (default 20 chunks) using the same hybrid
search as Plain RAG, then **re-orders it with a cross-encoder** before passing
the top-k to the LLM.

Reranker cascade (auto-selects the first that loads):

1. **Jina Reranker v2** (`jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual`) — the
   primary. Multilingual cross-encoder; runs locally from HuggingFace.
2. **BGE Reranker v2** (`BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`) — fallback if Jina fails to
   load.
3. **LLM pointwise reranker** — final fallback: asks the configured LLM to score
   each passage 0–10 for relevance.

Cross-encoders are slower than bi-encoders but more accurate because they see
the query *and* the passage together in a single forward pass.

### 3. HyDE — Hypothetical Document Embeddings (`hyde`)

Instead of embedding the raw query (which may be short and underspecified),
HyDE asks the LLM to **draft a plausible answer passage** first, then embeds
*that* passage and retrieves on its vector.

Pipeline:

1. LLM generates a 4–6 sentence hypothetical answer (instructed to sound like
   a document excerpt, not a hedged response).
2. The hypothetical passage is embedded as a *document* vector — placing it in
   the same semantic neighbourhood as real passages that answer the question.
3. Hybrid search runs on the hypothetical vector (dense) + the original query
   (BM25), combining the benefits of both.

Works best when the gap between query-space and answer-space is large (e.g.
short factual questions vs. long technical passages).

---

### 4. Corrective RAG — CRAG (`corrective`)

Retrieves first, then **grades** each retrieved document for relevance. If
the retrieved set is weak, it takes a *corrective action* before generating.

Pipeline:

1. **Initial retrieval** — hybrid search over a wide candidate pool.
2. **Grading** — the LLM scores the top-8 candidates 0–1 for relevance to the
   query (structured JSON output). Each score and reason is logged in the trace.
3. **Decision** — if fewer than `min_good=3` chunks pass the
   `relevance_threshold=0.5`, CRAG triggers correction:
   - LLM **rewrites** the query into 3 more specific sub-queries (decomposing
     compound questions).
   - Each sub-query is retrieved independently and the new candidates are graded.
4. **Knowledge filtering** — only chunks that pass the relevance threshold are
   passed to the LLM. If still nothing passes, the best-effort set is used.

CRAG is valuable when initial retrieval habitually surfaces related but
off-topic chunks (e.g. partial keyword matches).

---

### 5. Agentic RAG (`agentic`)

An LLM **agent** that plans its own retrieval, reflects on what it gathered,
and decides whether to issue follow-up searches — up to `max_iters=3` rounds.

Pipeline:

1. **Plan** — the agent decomposes the question into 2–3 focused sub-queries
   (structured JSON output).
2. **Retrieve** — each sub-query is run through hybrid search; results are
   merged and de-duplicated (keeping the highest score per chunk).
3. **Reflect** — the agent reads the gathered evidence and decides:
   - `sufficient: true` → proceed to answer generation.
   - `sufficient: false` + up to 2 follow-up queries → loop back to step 2.
4. The final merged chunk set (scored by relevance) is ranked and the top-k
   passed to the LLM for answering.

Agentic RAG handles multi-hop questions where a single retrieval pass misses
the full picture. The transparency trace shows each iteration's sub-queries and
the agent's sufficiency verdict.

### 6. GraphRAG (`graph`)

Builds a **knowledge graph** of entities and relationships offline (at index
time), detects Louvain communities, summarises each community with the LLM, and
at query time uses entity anchoring to retrieve structurally related chunks.

**Offline build** (`python -m rag_lab.cli graph`):

1. Samples up to `graph_max_chunks=240` chunks round-robin across documents.
2. For each chunk, the LLM extracts **entities** (name + type) and
   **relationships** (source → target + description) as structured JSON.
3. An undirected `networkx` graph is built; Louvain community detection
   partitions it into thematic clusters.
4. Each community is summarised with a short LLM-generated paragraph and the
   summary is stored alongside the graph.

**Query-time retrieval**:

1. LLM extracts key entities/concepts from the query (1 LLM call).
2. Entity nodes are matched in the graph (exact + fuzzy token overlap), then
   **expanded to 1-hop neighbours**.
3. Chunks are scored as `0.6 × dense_similarity + 0.4 × entity_overlap_ratio`.
4. Community summaries of matched entities are surfaced in the trace for
   transparency.
5. **Hybrid backfill** — if the graph is sparse, standard hybrid retrieval tops
   up the result set.

GraphRAG benefits domains with rich entity relationships (e.g. medical
knowledge, interconnected technical concepts) where co-citation matters more
than passage-level similarity.

## Evaluation Pipeline

Goldens are synthesized from gold chunks (pairs of adjacent same-document
chunks) by DeepEval's `Synthesizer`, then used to evaluate every approach.

### Metrics (DeepEval)

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Answer Relevancy** | How directly the generated answer addresses the question |
| **Faithfulness** | Whether every claim in the answer is supported by the retrieved context |
| **Contextual Relevancy** | How relevant the retrieved chunks are to the question |
| **Contextual Precision** | What fraction of retrieved chunks are actually useful |
| **Contextual Recall** | How much of the gold answer is covered by retrieved chunks |
| **Correctness (G-Eval)** | Factual correctness vs. the reference answer (custom criteria) |
| **Composite** | Mean of the six metrics above |

### How Each Metric Works

One knowledge-graph diagram per metric, generated with the plot MCP server and
verified by automated visual QA (Qwen3 vision model).

| Metric | Inputs | Diagram |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Answer Relevancy | `input`, `actual_output` | ![Answer Relevancy](docs/deepeval/answer_relevancy.png) |
| Faithfulness | `actual_output`, `retrieval_context` | ![Faithfulness](docs/deepeval/faithfulness.png) |
| Contextual Relevancy | `input`, `retrieval_context` | ![Contextual Relevancy](docs/deepeval/contextual_relevancy.png) |
| Contextual Precision | `input`, `expected_output`, `retrieval_context` | ![Contextual Precision](docs/deepeval/contextual_precision.png) |
| Contextual Recall | `expected_output`, `retrieval_context` | ![Contextual Recall](docs/deepeval/contextual_recall.png) |
| Correctness (G-Eval) | `actual_output`, `expected_output` | ![Correctness G-Eval](docs/deepeval/correctness_geval.png) |

### Retrieval-level metrics (custom, on top of DeepEval)

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Gold-chunk hit rate** | Fraction of goldens where ≥1 gold chunk appears in the top-k |
| **Gold-doc hit rate** | Fraction where the gold document appears (looser) |
| **Avg latency (s)** | End-to-end wall-clock per question (retrieval + generation) |
| **Avg context chars** | Total characters passed to the LLM per question |
| **Avg # contexts** | Mean chunks per answer |

Results are written incrementally to `data/eval/results.json` (per approach) so
the dashboard updates live as each approach finishes.

OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434

# Chunking (dynamic — splits on paragraph/heading boundaries)
# RAG_MIN_CHUNK_CHARS=120   # skip fragments shorter than this

# Retrieval
RAG_TOP_K=5                 # chunks fed to LLM
RAG_CANDIDATE_K=20          # pre-rerank pool size
RAG_BM25_WEIGHT=0.35        # hybrid fusion weight

> **Note on rate limits (Claude provider):** this org has a ~5 RPM limit across
> all Claude models. The client applies a 4 RPM token-bucket limiter per model
> automatically. A full eval run with 100 goldens takes roughly 15–20 hours.
> Increase `RAG_GEN_CONCURRENCY=1` (already the safe default) to avoid
> exhausting retries.
